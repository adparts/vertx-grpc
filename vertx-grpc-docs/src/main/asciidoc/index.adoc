gRPC is an open source remote procedure call (RPC) system initially developed at Google. It uses HTTP/2 for
transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication,
bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. It
generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages.
